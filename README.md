# Hii,

wow i changed the readme for this one? this must be big..
WELL IT IS
this is a mark reaction for everything youd ever need
playing valheim? hes there
playing fnaf? hes not there, fnaf doesnt let me overlay him ):
if you want to compile it yourself feel free to run:

```bat
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon="favicon.ico" --distpath ..\dist --workpath ..\build index.py
```

or download it from [files.roxcelic.love/funny/funny.exe](https://files.roxcelic.love/funny/funny.exe)
ill also probably add it to github releases if youd want it that way
